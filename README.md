# firefly-iii-reencrypt-database
This repository contains the necessary PHP and Bash scripts to re-encrypt (most of) the contents of the Firefly III database.

Please edit the `reencrypt.sh` script with the database connection data of your Firefly III installation.
Then, run the script, e.g. with `/bin/bash reencrypt.sh`.

You need to have `PHP` installed, but you probably have it already, if you used to run Firefly III on the same machine.
